# Enable IP Restrictions Per Inbound
`!!! NO NEED TO DO THIS IF YOU HAVE FRESH INSTALL`

1 - open panel settings and tab xray related settings find `"api": ` and put bellow code just before it :
 ```json
 "log": {
    "loglevel": "warning", 
    "access": "./access.log"
  }, 
```
- change access log path as you want

2 - add **IP limit and Unique Email** for inbound(vmess & vless)

`!!! NO NEED TO DO THIS IF YOU HAVE FRESH INSTALL`

**for enable traffic for users you should do :**

find this in config : 
``` json
 "policy": {
    "system": {
```
**and add this just after  ` "policy": {` :**
```json
    "levels": {
      "0": {
        "statsUserUplink": true,
        "statsUserDownlink": true
      }
    },
```


**the final output is like :**
```json
  "policy": {
    "levels": {
      "0": {
        "statsUserUplink": true,
        "statsUserDownlink": true
      }
    },

    "system": {
      "statsInboundDownlink": true,
      "statsInboundUplink": true
    }
  },
  "routing": {
```
 restart panel
# Install & Upgrade

```
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4xmen/x-ui/master/install.sh)
```

## Manual install & upgrade

1. First download the latest compressed package from https://github.com/4xmen/x-ui/releases , generally choose Architecture `amd64`
2. Then upload the compressed package to the server's `/root/` directory and `root` rootlog in to the server with user

> If your server cpu architecture is not `amd64` replace another architecture

```
cd /root/
rm x-ui/ /usr/local/x-ui/ /usr/bin/x-ui -rf
tar zxvf x-ui-linux-amd64.tar.gz
chmod +x x-ui/x-ui x-ui/bin/xray-linux-* x-ui/x-ui.sh
cp x-ui/x-ui.sh /usr/bin/x-ui
cp -f x-ui/x-ui.service /etc/systemd/system/
mv x-ui/ /usr/local/
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable x-ui
systemctl restart x-ui
```

## Install using docker

> This docker tutorial and docker image are provided by [4xmen](https://github.com/4xmen)

1. install docker

```shell
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

2. install x-ui

```shell
mkdir x-ui && cd x-ui
docker run -itd --network=host \
    -v $PWD/db/:/etc/x-ui/ \
    -v $PWD/cert/:/root/cert/ \
    --name x-ui --restart=unless-stopped \
    4xmen/x-ui:latest
```

> Build your own image

```shell
docker build -t x-ui .
```

## SSL certificate application

> This feature and tutorial are provided by [FranzKafkaYu](https://github.com/FranzKafkaYu)

The script has a built-in SSL certificate application function. To use this script to apply for a certificate, the following conditions must be met:

- Know the Cloudflare registered email
- Know the Cloudflare Global API Key
- The domain name has been resolved to the current server through cloudflare

How to get the Cloudflare Global API Key:
    ![](media/bda84fbc2ede834deaba1c173a932223.png)
    ![](media/d13ffd6a73f938d1037d0708e31433bf.png)

When using, just enter `email`, `domain`, `API KEY` and the schematic diagram is as follows：
        ![](media/2022-04-04_141259.png)

Precautions:

- The script uses DNS API for certificate request
- By default, Let'sEncrypt is used as the CA party
- The certificate installation directory is the /root/cert directory
- The certificates applied for by this script are all generic domain name certificates

## Tg robot use (under development, temporarily unavailable)

> This feature and tutorial are provided by [FranzKafkaYu](https://github.com/FranzKafkaYu)

X-UI supports daily traffic notification, panel login reminder and other functions through the Tg robot. To use the Tg robot, you need to apply for the specific application tutorial. You can refer to the [blog](https://coderfan.net/how-to-use-telegram-bot-to-alarm-you-when-someone-login-into-your-vps.html)
Set the robot-related parameters in the panel background, including:

- Tg Robot Token
- Tg Robot ChatId
- Tg robot cycle runtime, in crontab syntax


Reference syntax:

- 30 * * * * * //Notify at the 30s of each point
- @hourly // hourly notification
- @daily // Daily notification (00:00 in the morning)
- @every 8h // notify every 8 hours
- TG notification content:

- Node traffic usage
- Panel login reminder
- Node expiration reminder
- Traffic warning reminder

More features are planned...


## suggestion system

- CentOS 7+
- Ubuntu 16+
- Debian 8+

# common problem

## Migrating from v2-ui

First install the latest version of x-ui on the server where v2-ui is installed, and then use the following command to migrate, which will migrate the native v2-ui `All inbound account data` to x-ui，`Panel settings and username passwords are not migrated`

> Please `Close v2-ui` and `restart x-ui`, otherwise the inbound of v2-ui will cause a `port conflict with the inbound of x-ui`

```
x-ui v2-ui
```
